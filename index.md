title: Hello!
---

I'm Arlie Coles, a deep learning applied researcher and software developer with a passion for linguistics and good coding practices.

I first became interested in NLP and ASR working at the [Montreal Computational & Quantitative Linguistics Lab](https://mcqll.org/) under Morgan Sonderegger. I further pursued these subjects into the realm of machine learning while studying at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) (Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute), and am excited about applying well-crafted, extensible, and practical solutions to natural language problems in this rapidly growing field. I now work as a Research Scientist at [Nuance Communications](https://nuance.com/).

I also love music theory, liturgy, and playing the piano!
